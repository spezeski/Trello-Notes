This extension adds "sticky notes" to the cards in Trello.  The notes can be read and edited without opening the card.

To add a note to a card, click the "Note" badge.  To edit a note, click inside the box.  When you are done editing, press Tab to save the changes.

The notes are stored in the first line of the card descriptions.  They are preceded by ">>>> ", and will appear in the description as quoted text.  Users without the plugin will not see the notes on the card face, but they will see them in the card description.
